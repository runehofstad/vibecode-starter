# ðŸš€ Performance Guide - Vibecode Starter

## Core Web Vitals
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): <2.5s
- First Input Delay (FID): <100ms
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): <0.1
- Use Lighthouse to monitor and improve

## Bundle Optimization
- Use code splitting and dynamic imports
- Remove unused dependencies
- Minimize third-party scripts
- Use tree-shaking with ES modules

## Image Optimization
- Use next-gen formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Serve responsive images (srcset)
- Use image CDNs or Supabase Storage
- Lazy load offscreen images

## Lazy Loading
- Lazy load components and routes with React.lazy
- Use Suspense for fallback loading states

## Caching Strategies
- Use HTTP caching headers for static assets
- Use SWR or React Query for client-side data caching
- Implement service workers for PWA support

## Mobile Performance
- Optimize for slow networks and low-end devices
- Minimize main thread work
- Use native navigation and gestures on mobile

## Monitoring
- Use Sentry or LogRocket for performance monitoring
- Set up alerts for slow API responses

## Best Practices
- Test performance before every release
- Continuously monitor and optimize
