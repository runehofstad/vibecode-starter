# 🚀 VIBECODE STARTER

A complete starter kit for efficient development with both Claude Code CLI and Cursor IDE.

## ✨ What is this?

VIBECODE STARTER provides:
- ✅ Pre-configured standards for modern web and mobile development
- ✅ **GitHub template** for instant project setup
- ✅ **Sub-Agents system** for specialized development tasks (NEW!)
- ✅ Context7 integration for up-to-date documentation
- ✅ Comprehensive cheat sheets and guides
- ✅ Best practices for professional developers

## 🚀 How to Use This Template

### Step 1: Create Your Project
1. **Click "Use this template"** button on [GitHub](https://github.com/runehofstad/vibecode-starter)
2. Name your new repository
3. Choose Public or Private
4. Click **"Create repository from template"**

### Step 2: Clone and Setup
```bash
# Clone your new repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-new-repo.git
cd your-new-repo

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Step 3: Initialize with Claude Code
Open Claude Code and run one of these commands:
```bash
"Initialize as React web app with Supabase"
"Initialize as React Native mobile app"
"Initialize as Next.js full-stack app"
"Initialize as API backend"
"Analyze and configure project"  # Auto-detect
```

### Step 4: Add Helper Files to Your .gitignore
**IMPORTANT:** Keep your repo clean by adding this to YOUR project's `.gitignore`:
```bash
# Add claude-starter to your gitignore
echo -e "\n# Claude helper files (local only)\nclaude-starter/\n.claude/" >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add claude-starter to gitignore"
```

### Step 5: Start Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

You now have:
- ✅ Clean project repository (only your code in git)
- ✅ All 29 Sub-Agents available locally
- ✅ Full documentation in `claude-starter/docs/`
- ✅ Claude Code fully configured and ready

## 📦 What You Get

When you use this template, your project starts clean with only essential files:

```
your-project/
├── config/                     # Build configurations
│   ├── .eslintrc.json
│   ├── .prettierrc
│   ├── tailwind.config.js
│   ├── tsconfig.json
│   └── vite.config.ts
├── src/                        # Your application code (to be created)
├── CLAUDE.md                   # Simple Claude Code instructions
├── package.json                # Dependencies
├── postcss.config.js
├── .gitignore                  # Includes claude-starter/
└── LICENSE
```

## 📚 Claude Starter Kit

The template includes full documentation and Sub-Agents in `claude-starter/`:

```
claude-starter/                 # All Claude helper files
├── .claude/                    # Claude configuration
│   ├── config/                 # PROJECT_CONFIG, INIT_PROMPTS, etc.
│   └── .cursorrules           
├── docs/                       
│   ├── agents/                 # 29 specialized Sub-Agents
│   └── guides/                 # All user guides
└── CLAUDE_FULL.md              # Full instructions
```

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: After creating your project

**Add to YOUR project's .gitignore:**
```gitignore
# Claude helper files (keep locally, don't commit to your project)
claude-starter/
.claude/
```

This keeps your project repository clean while maintaining access to all helper files locally.

## 🤖 NEW: Sub-Agents System

Leverage **29 specialized AI agents** for different development tasks:

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: How to Activate Sub-Agents

**Sub-Agents are NOT automatic!** You must explicitly tell Claude Code to use them:

1. **CLAUDE.md file now included** - This helps Claude Code recognize when to use agents
2. **Explicit references required** - Always mention the agent file when giving tasks
3. **See AGENT_EXAMPLES.md** for complete usage examples

### Core Development Agents
- **Frontend Agent** – React, TypeScript, UI/UX development
- **Backend Agents** – Supabase, Firebase, AWS backends
- **Mobile Agents** – React Native, iOS/Swift, Flutter
- **Testing Agent** – Jest, Playwright, comprehensive testing

### Infrastructure & Operations
- **DevOps Agent** – CI/CD, deployment, infrastructure
- **Docker/Container Agent** – Containerization, orchestration
- **Monitoring Agent** – Observability, logging, metrics
- **Security Agent** – Authentication, GDPR, security audits

### Specialized Agents
- **API/GraphQL Agent** – REST, GraphQL, API design
- **Database Migration Agent** – Schema migrations, data sync
- **Payment Agent** – Stripe, Vipps, e-commerce
- **WebSocket Agent** – Real-time features, live updates
- **Email/Communication Agent** – Transactional email, SMS, push
- **And 14 more specialized agents...**

### 🚀 Quick Start - How to Use Agents

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Explicitly reference the agent
claude "Use docs/agents/frontend-agent.md to create a responsive dashboard"

# ✅ CORRECT - Multiple agents for complex tasks
claude "Read frontend-agent.md and backend-agent.md, then build user authentication"

# ❌ WRONG - No agent reference (Claude won't use agents)
claude "Create a dashboard"
```
