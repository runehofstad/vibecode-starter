# 🚀 Vibecode Starter - The Ultimate AI-Powered Development Template

## What is Vibecode Starter?

Vibecode Starter is a revolutionary GitHub template that transforms how developers work with AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and other AI coding tools. It's not just another boilerplate – it's a complete AI-enhanced development ecosystem with 29 specialized Sub-Agents that understand every aspect of modern software development.

## 🎯 Why Vibecode Starter?

### The Problem
- Starting new projects with AI tools often means explaining your tech stack over and over

- **Instant AI Context**: Your AI assistant immediately understands your entire tech stack
- **29 Specialized Sub-Agents**: From frontend to DevOps, each agent is an expert in its domain
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out-of-the-box with Claude, Cursor, and other AI tools
- **Production-Ready Setup**: TypeScript, React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and your choice of backend
- **Best Practices Built-in**: ESLint, Prettier, testing, and Git workflows pre-configured
