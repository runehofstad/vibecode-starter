## Interactive Mode Examples

When in interactive Claude Code session:

### Explicit Agent Reference
```
You: Create a user authentication system

Better: Read docs/agents/backend-agent.md for auth logic, 
docs/agents/frontend-agent.md for login UI, and 
docs/agents/security-agent.md for security best practices, 
then implement a complete authentication system
```

### Step-by-Step with Agents
```
You: Let's build a dashboard

Better: 
1. First, review docs/agents/frontend-agent.md for component standards
2. Check docs/agents/backend-agent.md for API requirements
3. Build the dashboard following both specifications
```

### Agent-Driven Development
```
You: Fix the performance issues

Better: 
1. Use docs/agents/data-agent.md to analyze database performance
2. Apply docs/agents/frontend-agent.md for UI optimizations
3. Follow docs/agents/monitoring-observability-agent.md to add metrics
```

## CLI Flags for Agents

### Direct Agent Usage
```bash
# Specific agent with task
claude --agent docs/agents/frontend-agent.md "Create responsive navigation"

# Multiple agents (conceptual - requires orchestration)
claude --orchestrate "Build complete feature using all relevant agents"
```

### With Context Sharing
```bash
# Continue from previous agent work
claude --context=shared "Continue the authentication implementation from backend-agent"
```

## Project Setup Commands

### Initial Project Configuration
```bash
# 1. Clone the starter
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start with agent guidance
claude "Review all agents in docs/agents/ and set up the project structure according to their standards"
```

### Feature Development Flow
```bash
# 1. Plan with agents
claude "Review relevant agents for user profile feature and create implementation plan"

# 2. Implement backend
claude "Use backend-agent.md to implement user profile API"

# 3. Implement frontend
claude "Use frontend-agent.md to create profile UI components"

# 4. Add tests
claude "Use testing-agent.md to write comprehensive tests"

# 5. Security review
claude "Use security-agent.md to audit the implementation"
```

## Tips for Effective Agent Usage

1. **Always be specific** about which agent to use
2. **Reference multiple agents** for complex tasks
3. **Read agent specs first** before implementation
4. **Follow agent standards** exactly
5. **Use agents for code review** after implementation

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Feature Development
```bash
claude "For the [FEATURE NAME] feature:
1. Use backend-agent.md for API design
2. Use frontend-agent.md for UI implementation  
3. Use testing-agent.md for test coverage
4. Use security-agent.md for security review"
```

### Pattern: Bug Fix
```bash
claude "To fix [BUG DESCRIPTION]:
1. Analyze using relevant agent (frontend/backend/mobile)
2. Implement fix following agent standards
3. Add tests per testing-agent.md"
```

### Pattern: Performance Optimization
```bash
claude "To optimize [AREA]:
1. Use data-agent.md for analysis
2. Apply optimizations per relevant agent
3. Add monitoring per monitoring-observability-agent.md"
```

## Remember

- Agents are **specifications**, not automatic processes
- You must **explicitly reference** them
- They work best when **used together**
- Always **follow their standards**
- The CLAUDE.md file helps with **automatic recognition**
